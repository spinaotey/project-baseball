# Project: Baseball Data

## NumPy and Pandas put into practice

This project is proposed at the end of the course of
[Intro to Data Analysis: Data Analysis Using NumPy and Pandas](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)
of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) in order to put
into practice what was learned during that course.

To do so, we are
going to make a Data Analysis of the
[Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/),
which contains complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2015, 
plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records,
post-season data, and more.

Our main focus will be in using the tools of NumPy and Pandas we have
learned along the course. We will try to expand them by using SciPy's
Statistics library and get some interesting results. 

The results will be exposed in a Jupyter notebook.
