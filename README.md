# Project: Baseball Data

## NumPy and Pandas put into practice

This project is proposed at the end of the course of
[Intro to Data Analysis: Data Analysis Using NumPy and Pandas](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)
of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) in order to put
into practice what was learned during that course. We are
going to make a Data Analysis of the
[Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/),
which contains complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2015, 
plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records,
post-season data, and more.
